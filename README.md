Turf-PHP is a PHP port of [**Turf.js**](https://turfjs.org), a powerful spatial analysis library.
This package provides robust GeoJSON-based geospatial functions for use in PHP applications, allowing you
to perform geometry operations, boolean calculations, and spatial analysis with ease.

### NOTE: This is a very early effort to port functionality!
It is incomplete and there should be a reasonable expectation that some output may differ slightly from
Turf.js, and some may be outright broken. If you need a feature that's not available, or not working
correctly, please consider opening a pull request!


## üöÄ Features

- Supports **PHP 8.2+**
- Implements key **Turf.js** functions
- Uses **GeoJSON** as the standard input and output format, leveraging the [jmikola/geojson](https://github.com/jmikola/geojson) package. 
- Includes **boolean operations**, **spatial analysis**, and **geometry transformations**

## üì¶ Installation

For the moment, you have to install from this repo. It will be published and accessible via composer in the near future.

[//]: # (Install Turf-PHP using **Composer**:)

## üõ† Usage

Turf-PHP provides various functions to work with geospatial data. Below are some examples of how to use it
in your PHP application.

### Example: Calculating the area of a FeatureCollection

```php
use GeoJson\GeoJson;
use willvincent\Turf\Turf;

$featureCollection = GeoJson::jsonUnserialize(json_decode('
    {"type":"FeatureCollection","features":[{"type":"Feature","properties":{"name":"LAX"},
     "geometry":{"coordinates":[[[-118.43130558364376,33.94968604365768],[-118.4012727129631,33.952569329158464],
     [-118.40029702645336,33.951330030271265],[-118.39709555509219,33.95155765795056],

'));

// Default is Square Meters, but you can easily
// request a different unit of measure with a second parameter
$area = Turf::area($featureCollection);

$square_miles = Turf::area($featureCollection, 'miles');
```

### Example: Checking if a Point is in a Polygon

```php
use GeoJson\Geometry\Point;
use GeoJson\Geometry\Polygon;
use willvincent\Turf\Turf;

$point = new Point([-77, 44]);
$polygon = new Polygon([
    [[-81, 41], [-81, 47], [-72, 47], [-72, 41], [-81, 41]]
]);

echo Turf::booleanPointInPolygon($point, $polygon) ? 'true' : 'false'; // Output: true
```

### Example: Generating a square grid

```php
use GeoJson\Feature\Feature;
use GeoJson\Feature\FeatureCollection;
use GeoJson\Geometry\Polygon;
use willvincent\Turf\Turf;

$polygon1 = new Polygon([
  [
    [-87.62411094338104, 41.880714036293114],
    [-87.62411094338104, 41.87843046431638],
    [-87.6209051112661, 41.87843046431638],
    [-87.6209051112661, 41.880714036293114],
    [-87.62411094338104, 41.880714036293114]
  ]
]);
$polygon2 = new Polygon([
  [
    [-87.61655715285198, 41.884051046913896],
    [-87.61541915184196, 41.884164700799886],
    [-87.61534976153654, 41.88380307409719],
    [-87.61648776254657, 41.88369975180643],
    [-87.61655715285198, 41.884051046913896]
  ]
]);

$featureCollection = new FeatureCollection([
  new Feature($polygon1),
  new Feature($polygon2)
]);

// Draw a bounding box around our feature collection
$bbox = Turf::bbox($featureCollection);

// Generate a grid from the bounding box
$grid = Turf::squareGrid($bbox, 0.25, 'kilometers');
```

## üìö Supported Functions

The following spatial analysis functions are currently implemented:

- ‚úÖ `along` - Takes a LineString and returns a Point at a specified distance along the line.
- ‚úÖ `angle` - Finds the angle formed by two adjacent segments defined by 3 points.
- ‚úÖ `area` - Calculates the geodesic area in square meters (or other units) of one or more polygons.
- ‚úÖ `bbox` - Calculates the bounding box for any GeoJSON object, including FeatureCollection
- ‚úÖ `bearing` - Takes two points and finds the geographic bearing between them (NOTE: Output varies slightly from TurfJS calculations, presumably precision differences)
- ‚úÖ `distance` - Calculate the distance between two points

The following generative and manipulation functions are currently implemented:

- ‚úÖ `bboxClip` - Clips a feature to the bbox
- ‚úÖ `bboxPolygon` - Takes a bbox and returns an equivalent polygon.
